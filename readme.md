2. Open the browser developer tools (usually `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
3. Go to the "Network" tab and reload the Instagram page.
4. Filter requests by "Cookies" and locate the `sessionid` cookie in the headers.
5. Copy the `sessionid` value and paste it into the `sessiontoken` field in `config.json`.
